API Documentation
=================

The project offers 3 main APIs. At the core is the [C API](c_api.md) for all
the functionality exposed by the cross-platform library. The C API is available
on all platforms.
In addition, there is a [Swift API](swift_api.md) for iOS, and a
[Kotlin API](kotlin_api.md) for Android.
Those APIs offer a more language-idiomatic access to the same functionality
that may otherwise be accessed through the C API, which is much more convenient
for mobile developers.
