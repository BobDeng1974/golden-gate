Kotlin API
==========

The Kotlin API offers Kotlin language bindings for the functionality
implemented by the core library. The bindings are written as a combination
of Kotlin code and JNI C/C++ code. While it is always possible to directly
reach all the C functions through JNI on Android, it is recommended to use
the Kotlin bindings whenever possible.

packages.
If you want to send or receive a message over Golden Gate, you're probably most
interested in the bindings.coap package, specifically the Endpoint interface.
