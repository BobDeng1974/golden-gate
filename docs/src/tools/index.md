Tools
=====

A few command-line tools are included in the project. They can be used as 
tools to perform specific tasks, but also as examples of how an application may
use the Golden Gate APIs.

The tools include:

  * The [Stack Tool](stack_tool.md) - swiss-army-knife tool that can be used to 
    run different configurations of a Golden Gate stack, in a process, connected 
    to both another stack on another device through a link/transport, and a 
    client or server app that can communicate through the stack.
  * The [CoAP Client](coap_client.md) - simple command-line CoAP client built
    using the Golden Gate CoAP API.
  * The [CoAP Server](coap_client.md) - example command-line CoAP server built
    using the Golden Gate CoAP API.
