/**
 * Request filter that filters out requests based on the *group* memberships
 * of the handler that is selected to handle a request.
 * Group memberships of a handler are specified at the time the handler
 * is registered, using membership flags as part of the handler flags.
 * There are 4 flag bits reserved for group membership (hence 4 possible
 * groups that a handler can be a member of, in addition to group 0):
 * GG_COAP_REQUEST_HANDLER_FLAG_GROUP_{1,2,3,4}
 *
 * At any point in time, the filter has a *current group* property. When
 * a request is received, the filter will let it pass through if the handler
 * for that request is in the current group, otherwise a GG_COAP_MESSAGE_CODE_FORBIDDEN
 * response is returned.
 *
 * Note that all handlers are automatically implicitly part of group 0, and
 * the default value for the current group is 0 when the filter is first created.
 * This means that by default, all requests will pass through the filter.
