!!! warning "Work In Progress"

    This documentation is not yet complete. As we migrate the project from
    an internal project to one that can be shared with others, we are busy
    migrating some of the documentation from internal Wiki pages, Google docs
    and slide decks.

Golden Gate is a portable cross-platform framework that offers reliable and
secure network communication between different combinations of embedded
devices, mobile applications and desktop applications.
It can run in many environments, from embedded systems with very limited
resources like wearables and IoT devices, to mobile and desktop.
The project consists of:

 * A core library written in C
 * Language bindings for higher level languages, including Kotlin and Swift
 * A modular build system based on CMake
 * Code examples
 * Tools and applications
 * Support for test automation
 * Documentation

 By building the core libraries and sample applications included in the
 project's repo, you'll be able to start experimenting right away with 
 different combinations of devices connecting and communicating with each
 other, including:
  * iPhones and iPads
  * Android phones and tablets
  * Desktops and laptops (macOS, Linux, Windows)
  * Embedded development boards (nRF52840-DK, Espressif ESP32, ...)

And by integrating the libraries in your own app or IoT device, 
leveraging some of the examples included in the project, you will be able to
start building your own communicating applications and services.
